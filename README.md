# OktaAngularAppInitializerRepro

This repo is a minimal repoduction of the issue described [here](https://github.com/okta/okta-angular/issues/122).

The `master` branch contains the error described and the `working-in-v-3-1-0` branch shows it works before I started upgrading the dependency.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
